# Wokingham Library Code Club

These are the github pages of the **Wokingham Library Code Club**, located in Wokingham, UK and supported by [Wokingham Borough Council](https://www.wokingham.gov.uk/libraries).

The club is for children aged 9 to 13, and we run twice a month in Wokingham Library, on the first and fourth Saturday of each month, with an early session mostly for Scratch coding followed by a later session for Python coding.

These pages contain information for students about forthcoming sessions, detailed information for lots of the projects we have developed in the past, as well as background information.

Students wishing to join the Code Club will need to register with Wokingham library. For information about registering and any other enquiries about the Code Club please contact Wokingham library: libraryevents@wokingham.gov.uk

### About this website

As is normal on github, the data on this site is divided into ***repositories*** and each repository (repo for short) contains all the information for a single coding project, or a group of projects. One repository, called [OnlineCodeclub](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/OnlineCodeclub/blob/master/README.md), contains a wide range of Scratch and Python projects, each of which is explained through a series of Youtube videos, and the links to all these videos can be found in the *OnlineCodeClub* repository. (These projects were created while the code club was operating online during the coronavirus restrictions.)

For a summary of the contents of all the repositories see [here](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/woklibcodeclub.github.io), or see the [complete list of repositories](https://github.com/orgs/WokLibCodeClub/repositories?type=all).

## Scratch (first session 10.30am to 11.30am)

The next session will take place on **Saturday 6th September 2025**. As this is the first session of the new school year we will be covering the basics of coding. This will involve the coding game called *Code for Life: Rapid Router*, and some beginner projects in Scratch. We will be coding on the library's own laptops, so you don't need to bring your own computer.

You will need a accounts for both *Scratch* and *Code for Life: Rapid Router* for the Code Club's Scratch sessions. 

Please try to arrive a little bit before 10.30am so that you have time to get logged in to your Code for Life and Scratch accounts and be ready to start at 10.30am. **MAKE SURE YOU KNOW THE PASSWORDS FOR YOUR ACCOUNTS!!!!**

### Scratch account

If you don't have an account already you can create one by going to [Join Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/join). You will need to use a parent's valid email address to sign up.

If you want to be able to *SHARE* your Scratch projects with the Code Club and other people you must make sure your account is *confirmed*. You do this by clicking the link on the confirmation email you recieve from Scratch when you create your account. If you don't receive this email follow  the instructions at [this link](https://scratch.mit.edu/faq/#accounts) in the section *How do I confirm my account?*. It seems to be quite common that people can't find the first email sent by Scratch. The instructions show how to have Scratch resend the email.

Scratch has produced a page of information for parents. You can find it [here](https://scratch.mit.edu/parents/).
