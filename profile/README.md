# Wokingham Library Code Club

These are the github pages of the **Wokingham Library Code Club**, located in Wokingham, UK and supported by [Wokingham Borough Council](https://www.wokingham.gov.uk/libraries).

The club is for children aged 9 to 13, and we run twice a month in Wokingham Library, on the first and fourth Saturday of each month, with an early session mostly for Scratch coding followed by a later session for Python coding.

These pages contain information for students about forthcoming sessions, detailed information for lots of the projects we have developed in the past, as well as background information.

Students wishing to join the Code Club will need to register with Wokingham library. For information about registering and any other enquiries about the Code Club please contact Wokingham library: libraryevents@wokingham.gov.uk

### About this website

As is normal on github, the data on this site is divided into ***repositories*** and each repository (repo for short) contains all the information for a single coding project, or a group of projects. One repository, called [OnlineCodeclub](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/OnlineCodeclub/blob/master/README.md), contains a wide range of Scratch and Python projects, each of which is explained through a series of Youtube videos, and the links to all these videos can be found in the *OnlineCodeClub* repository. (These projects were created while the code club was operating online during the coronavirus restrictions.)

For a summary of the contents of all the repositories see [here](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/woklibcodeclub.github.io), or see the [complete list of repositories](https://github.com/orgs/WokLibCodeClub/repositories?type=all).

## Scratch (first session 10.30am to 11.30am)

The next session will take place on **Saturday 1st November 2025**. We will be coding on the library's own laptops, so you don't need to bring your own computer.

We will start of with some more coding using the *Rapid Router* game, exploring more and more complicated versions of the *if* block, with level 42 being puzzling. (Hint: you don't *have* to use *if* blocks to solve level 42!) The link for Rapid Router is [https://www.codeforlife.education/rapidrouter/#](https://www.codeforlife.education/rapidrouter/#). ***Please note:*** you need a Code for Life login to access levels above 29. If you do not have a login please follow the instructions [below](#Code-for-Life-account) to make one. 

In Scratch we will continue coding the *Boat Race* project. The instructions for the game are on the Raspberry Pi website [here](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/boat-race), and we hope you will be able to develop the code by yourselves by following the instructions on the Raspberry Pi website. If you want to share your project with the Code Club your Scratch account needs to be *confirmed*. Instructions for doing this are [here](https://scratch.mit.edu/faq/#accounts) in the section *How do I confirm my account?*

Please try to arrive a little bit before 10.30am so that you have time to get logged in to your Code for Life and Scratch accounts and be ready to start at 10.30am. **MAKE SURE YOU KNOW THE PASSWORDS FOR YOUR ACCOUNTS!!!!**

### How to make a Scratch account

If you don't have an account already you can create one by going to [Join Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/join). You will need to use a parent's valid email address to sign up.

If you want to be able to *SHARE* your Scratch projects with the Code Club and other people you must make sure your account is *confirmed*. You do this by clicking the link on the confirmation email you recieve from Scratch when you create your account. If you don't receive this email follow  the instructions at [this link](https://scratch.mit.edu/faq/#accounts) in the section *How do I confirm my account?*. It seems to be quite common that people can't find the first email sent by Scratch. The instructions show how to have Scratch resend the email.

Scratch has produced a page of information for parents. You can find it [here](https://scratch.mit.edu/parents/).

**Link for the Code Club's Scratch _Studio_**

We use a *Studio* on the Scratch website for sharing projects in the Code Club sessions. The link to this is [WLCC 2025-2026](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/50686841)

### How to make a Code for Life account

To make a *Code for Life* account you will need to use a parent's email address. Go to [www.codeforlife.education/register_form](https://www.codeforlife.education/register_form): enter your date of birth in the **Independent learner** section then fill in the rest of the details, including your parent's email address. Once you have made an account you can login by going to [www.codeforlife.education/play/](https://www.codeforlife.education/play/) and clicking on the *Log in* button.

## Python (second session 11.45am to 12.45pm)

The next session will take place on **Saturday 1st November 2025**. We will be coding on the library's own laptops, so you don't need to bring your own computer.

We will continue with our *Python from the beginning* course, with an exploration of Python *lists* and the very important *for* repeat loop. If there's time we will start coding a little turtle game called *Catch the Ball*.

If you weren't at the last session here are the links for the code we wrote: for the code written on the screen for ***graphics*** to draw a multi-sided polygon go [here](https://trinket.io/python/04508e583559); for the code on the screen for the ***sorting hat*** project as we left it at the end of the last session go [here](https://trinket.io/python/55008dae53be). You can also catch up on all the material we have covered in our introduction to Python [here](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/Hello-Python/blob/main/step3/step3.md).

The code for the *times table* programme in the last session is [here](https://trinket.io/python/05b0a3c95659).

The starter project for the *Catch the Ball* game is [here](https://trinket.io/python/0e429f731b).

The code for the *Catch the Ball* game as it was at the end of the session on 25th October 2025 is [here](https://trinket.io/python/6fb8ab76d689).

Here is a link to a page which gives the complete list of available turtle colours (which you can use for background colour or turtle colour or pen colour): [www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp)

The link mentioned in the first session on 6th September 2025 for a fun BBC Bitesize course on learning to type properly is [Dance Mat Typing](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/articles/z3c6tfr).

### How to make a Trinket account

You will need a trinket account for the Code Club's Python sessions. If you don't have one already you can create one by going to [trinket.io/signup](https://trinket.io/signup). You will need a valid email address to create an account. You can find a guide for using a trinket account [here](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/Hello-Python/blob/main/trinket_basics/using_trinket.md).

Please try to arrive a little bit before 11.45am so that you have time to get logged in to your Trinket account and be ready to start at 11.45am. **MAKE SURE YOU KNOW THE PASSWORD FOR YOUR ACCOUNT!!!!**

#### If you already have some experience with coding in Python ####

you may find the beginners' course a bit too easy. Here is a good project you can work on by yourself:

[Turtle Race](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/turtle-race/0)

This is a project devised by Raspberry Pi/Code Club with a series of online instructions. ***Warning***: the link to "Open the Turtle race starter project" on the second page will take you to a different editor, where you will not be able to save your code. Instead, just open a new Trinket project and start your coding there. You will also need to add this line of code as the first line in your new project:

```python
#!/bin/python3
```
