# Wokingham Library Code Club

These are the github pages of the **Wokingham Library Code Club**, located in Wokingham, UK and supported by [Wokingham Borough Council](https://www.wokingham.gov.uk/libraries).

The club is for children aged 9 to 12, and we run twice a month in Wokingham Library, on the first and fourth Saturday of each month, with a session for Scratch coding followed by a session for Python coding.

These pages contain information for students about forthcoming sessions, detailed information for lots of the projects we have developed in the past, as well as background information.

As is normal on github, the data on this site is divided into ***repositories*** and each repository (repo for short) contains all the information for a single coding project, or a group of projects. One repository, called [OnlineCodeclub](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/OnlineCodeclub), contains a wide range of Scratch and Python projects, each of which is explained through a series of Youtube videos, and the links to all these videos can be found in the *OnlineCodeClub* repository. (These projects were created while the code club was operating online during the coronavirus restrictions.)

For a summary of the contents of all the repositories see [here](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/woklibcodeclub.github.io), or see the [complete list of repositories](https://github.com/orgs/WokLibCodeClub/repositories?type=all).

#### Lower Earley Code Club

Wokingham Libraries now also runs a Code Club at Lower Earley Library. Ask for details at Lower Earley Library.

## Next sessions

Our next sessions will take place on Saturday 23rd November 2024 at Wokingham Library.

## Scratch session, Saturday 23rd November 2024 at 10.30 am

You will need a Scratch account for this session, so if you don't have one already you should create one by going to [Join Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/join). You will need a valid email address to sign up.

Please make sure you arrive so that you have time to log in to your Scratch account and be ready to start coding at 10.30 am. ***PLEASE*** make sure you know your password (write it down if you need to) so that you are able to log in without a problem on Saturday.

**NOTE**: If you want to be able to *share* your Scratch projects with the club leaders and other coders your Scratch account needs to be *confirmed*. You can find the instructions for doing this at [this](https://scratch.mit.edu/faq/#accounts) weblink, under the heading *How do I confirm my account?*. It seems to be quite common that people can't find the first email sent by Scratch. In this case, follow the instructions to have Scratch resend the email.

Scratch has produced a page of information for parents. You can find it [here](https://scratch.mit.edu/parents/).

#### Rapid Router

At the last session lots of the students had great fun with the [Rapid Router game](https://www.codeforlife.education/rapidrouter) on the *Code For Life* website, so we will start our next session looking at some more of the challenges on this site where we introduce a *Repeat Until* block and the *If...Else* block. If you would like to save your progress and your code as you work through the levels, you should make yourself a *Code for Life* account by following the instructions:

#### Signing up for a Code for Life account

If you want to save your progress in *Code for Life* as you progress through the levels you can make a *Code for Life* account, and to do this you will need to use a parent's email address. We will show you how you can do this at the session, but you will need to do this at home during the week. The webpage for signing up is [https://www.codeforlife.education/register_form](https://www.codeforlife.education/register_form): enter your date of birth in the **Independent learner** section then fill in the rest of the details, including your parent's email address. Once you have made an account you can login by going to [codeforlife.education/play/](https://www.codeforlife.education/play/) and clicking on the Log in button.

We will also continue with Scratch projects which students have been working on. Some are still working on [Catch the bus](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/catch-the-bus) but for those that have finished that one we will move on to a project called [Find the Bug](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/find-the-bug).

## Python session, 23rd November at 11.45 am

You will need an account with [trinket](https://trinket.io/) for this session, so if you don't have one already you should create one by going to [trinket.io/signup](https://trinket.io/signup). You will need a valid email address to sign up.

Please make sure you arrive so that you have time to log in to your trinket account and be ready to start coding at 11.45 am.

We have now finished our mini-course introducing the basics of Python. We suggest that anyone who hasn't yet coded the [Turtle Race](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/turtle-race) project should have a go at that, followed by the [Secret Messages](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/secret-messages) project.


#### Super turtle race

For those that have completed the Turtle Race we will do a code-along session to make a super-charged version of this race, where you can make as many racing turtles as you want just by changing one number. Your best course is to make a copy of your own version of *turtle race* and use that to make the souped-up version. However, if you want to use a complete working version of this project to make the changes you can find the code to remix [here](https://trinket.io/python/5d45102efcbd)
 
Here is a demo of the basic Turtle Race (click Play to start it):

```
Special Instructions for Turtle Race and Secret Messages:
========================================================

DON'T follow the link to the starter project on the Raspberry Pi website
as this will take you to a different Python editor where you won't be able
to save your code.
Instead, create a New Project in your trinket account.
Start your code in trinket with the usual line:

#!/bin/python3

After that you can follow the instructions on the Raspberry Pi site.
```

#### Summary of the four sessions in the *Python from the beginning* mini-course:

In the first session on **28 September 2024** we learnt about the functions ```print()``` and ```input()```, and also *imported* other functions from different Python *libraries*. We saw the difference between *text strings*, *whole numbers (integers)* and *decimal or floating-point numbers*; and made some variables. You can find the code which was written on the screen during the first session by going to [https://trinket.io/python/104fce5c53d0](https://trinket.io/python/104fce5c53d0).

In the second session on **5 October 2024** we wrote an *Age calculator* programme which calculated a person's age given the year they were born, and also introduced the Python ```if``` command. The code for the *Age calculator* programme written on the screen is [here](https://trinket.io/python/b46b93f16311).

We also took the first steps in creating graphics in Python by starting a *turtles* project, introducing the turtle ```Screen()``` and how to make a ```Turtle()```. The code for the project as it was at the end of the session is [here](https://trinket.io/python/ecd09ad1ba40).

The list of colours which you can use for turtles and backgrounds can be found at [https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp).

A trinket project which explains the turtle coordinate system can be found [here](https://trinket.io/python/218c2a1835).

In the third session on **26 October 2024** we explored using the Python ```while``` loop to make a turtle draw polygon shapes with any number of sides. The code on the screen at the end of the session for this project is [here](https://trinket.io/python/dbc59805d99c). We also introduced Python **lists** and the Python ```for``` loop in a *sorting hat* project. The code on the screen at the end of the session for the *sorting hat* project is [here](https://trinket.io/python/aeef19b5fd9b).

In the final session on **2 November 2024** we explored the ```range()``` function and found that you could put one, two or even three parameters in the brackets. We used a ```for``` loop to print out a times table to jog your memory (the code on the screen for this project is [here](https://trinket.io/python/dc5a88c9c9fa)), and coded a simple turtle game called *Catch the ball* which introduced writing our own Python *functions* and how to make a turtle react to being clicked. The starter project for *Catch the ball* is [here](https://trinket.io/python/0e429f731b) and the code for the completed game written on the screen is [here](https://trinket.io/python/a8a5a1774047)
