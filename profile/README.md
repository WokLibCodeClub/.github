These are the github pages of the Wokingham Library Code Club, located in Wokingham, UK and supported by [Wokingham Borough Council](https://www.wokingham.gov.uk/libraries).

The club is for children aged 9 to 12, and we run twice a month in Wokingham library, on the first and fourth Saturday, with a session for Scratch projects followed by a session for Python projects.

These pages contain repositories for lots of the projects we have developed as well as some background information. One repository, called [OnlineCodeclub](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/OnlineCodeclub), lists the projects we created while the code club was operating online, during the coronavirus restrictions. For each of the online sessions we created a summary video afterwards, and the links to all these videos can be found in this repository.

For a summary of the contents of all the repositories see [here](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/woklibcodeclub.github.io), or see the list of all repositories below (click on the panel at the very bottom of the page that says "View all repositories" to see the complete list).

### Next sessions

Code Club has now finished for the summer but we will be back in September 2024! Watch this space for details nearer the time.

Have a great summer everyone!ðŸ˜Ž

#### Scratch

If you want to practise your coding over the summer there are lots of projects to try on the Raspberry Pi website. The link is
&nbsp;&nbsp;[projects.raspberrypi.org/en/collections/scratch](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/collections/scratch)

#### Python

If you want to work up some Python projects over the summer there are a lot of Python projects which the Wokingham Library Code Club developed during the Coronavirus pandemic. These projects all have videos to watch which you can code along with. Look at the projects on [this page](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/OnlineCodeclub) and look for the projects which use Python.

### Introduction to Python course (run from April to June 2024):

Here are some useful links for the four sessions of this short course.

**Week 1 - 27 April 2024**

We wrote some first Python code, introducing the basic functions ```print()``` and ```input()```. We also introduced Python *libraries*, which have to be imported. The code from the first week can be found at [trinket.io/python/05d317e0a9](https://trinket.io/python/05d317e0a9)

We also discussed the rules for how to *name variables*:

- Variable names can only include the lower case letters a-z, the upper case letters A-Z, the numbers 0-9 and the underscore _ character.

- Variable names must begin with a letter or the underscore character, never a number; and they can't have any spaces in them.

- It's a good idea to avoid calling variables with the same name as a Python function, like <code>print</code> or <code>input</code> or <code>name</code>.

- In addition there are some prohibited words (called keywords) that you absolutely ***can't*** use for variable names. These are:

> <code>and, as, assert, break, class, continue, def, del, elif, else, except, exec, finally, for, from, global, if, import, in, is, lambda, not, or, pass, print, raise, return, try, while, with, yield</code>

**Week 2 - 4 May 2024**

We extended the ideas of variables, and doing maths and wrote a programme to calculated someone's age given the year they were born. We had to learn the Python ```if``` block to make this work for everyone. The code for the *Age Calculator* is at [trinket.io/python/1c40b6db37](https://trinket.io/python/1c40b6db37).

**Week 3 - 25 May 2024**

We started doing Python graphics using the *turtle* library and wrote code to get the turtle to draw a regular polygon with any number of sides. The code we wrote in Week 3 is at [trinket.io/python/7407d0a2eb](https://trinket.io/python/7407d0a2eb)

The web page which shows all the named colours available in Python is at [w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp). You can choose any of these colours in a graphics programme by simply putting the colour name, as it appears on this page, inside quotes: for example ```"AntiqueWhite"```.

The trinket project which showed the x and y coordinates for the point where the mouse was clicked is at [trinket.io/python/218c2a1835](https://trinket.io/python/218c2a1835).

**Week 4 - 1 June 2024**

We coded a simple game called *Catch the ball* which involved writing code for clicking on a turtle, using an image file as the turtle shape, and writing our own functions.

You can find the starter project for the *Catch the ball* game at [trinket.io/python/0e429f731b](https://trinket.io/python/0e429f731b).

The code as it was at the end of the session is at [trinket.io/python/da871a6618](https://trinket.io/python/da871a6618).

### Challenges for more experience Python coders:

We have devised a series of Python coding challenges to test your abilities. You can find the challenges at
