# Wokingham Library Code Club

These are the github pages of the **Wokingham Library Code Club**, located in Wokingham, UK and supported by [Wokingham Borough Council](https://www.wokingham.gov.uk/libraries).

The club is for children aged 9 to 12, and we run twice a month in Wokingham Library, on the first and fourth Saturday of each month, with a session for Scratch coding followed by a session for Python coding.

These pages contain information for students about forthcoming sessions, detailed information for lots of the projects we have developed in the past, as well as background information.

As is normal on github, the data on this site is divided into ***repositories*** and each repository (repo for short) contains all the information for a single coding project, or a group of projects. One repository, called [OnlineCodeclub](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/OnlineCodeclub), contains a wide range of Scratch and Python projects, each of which is explained through a series of Youtube videos, and the links to all these videos can be found in the *OnlineCodeClub* repository. (These projects were created while the code club was operating online during the coronavirus restrictions.)

For a summary of the contents of all the repositories see [here](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/woklibcodeclub.github.io), or see the [complete list of repositories](https://github.com/orgs/WokLibCodeClub/repositories?type=all).

## Next sessions

We will be back after the holidays, and our next sessions will take place on Saturday 25th January 2025 at Wokingham Library.

## Scratch session, Saturday 25th January 2025 at 10.30 am

You will need a Scratch account for this session, so if you don't have one already you should create one by going to [Join Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/join). You will need a valid email address to sign up.

Please make sure you arrive so that you have time to log in to your Scratch account and be ready to start coding at 10.30 am. ***PLEASE*** make sure you know your password (write it down if you need to) so that you are able to log in without a problem on Saturday.

**NOTE**: If you want to be able to *share* your Scratch projects with the club leaders and other coders your Scratch account needs to be *confirmed*. You can find the instructions for doing this at [this](https://scratch.mit.edu/faq/#accounts) weblink, under the heading *How do I confirm my account?*. It seems to be quite common that people can't find the first email sent by Scratch. In this case, follow the instructions to have Scratch resend the email.

Scratch has produced a page of information for parents. You can find it [here](https://scratch.mit.edu/parents/).

### Rapid Router

We will start our next session with a bit more of the [Rapid Router game](https://www.codeforlife.education/rapidrouter) on the *Code For Life* website as some of our coders have been getting very enthusiastic about this. If you would like to save your progress and your code as you work through the levels, you should make yourself a *Code for Life* account by following the instructions below:

#### Signing up for a Code for Life account

If you want to save your progress in *Code for Life* as you progress through the levels you can make a *Code for Life* account, and to do this you will need to use a parent's email address. We will show you how you can do this at the session, but you will need to do this at home during the week. The webpage for signing up is [https://www.codeforlife.education/register_form](https://www.codeforlife.education/register_form): enter your date of birth in the **Independent learner** section then fill in the rest of the details, including your parent's email address. Once you have made an account you can login by going to [codeforlife.education/play/](https://www.codeforlife.education/play/) and clicking on the Log in button.

### Scratch

Congratulations to all the coders who had a great time playing *Scratch Coordinate Bingo* at the last session.

At the next session on 25th January we will continue with some of the Raspberry Pi Scratch projects which you can find [here](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/scratch-intro). Come back nearer the date for more details!

## Python session, 25th January 2025 at 11.45 am

You will need an account with [trinket](https://trinket.io/) for this session, so if you don't have one already you should create one by going to [trinket.io/signup](https://trinket.io/signup). You will need a valid email address to sign up.

Please make sure you arrive so that you have time to log in to your trinket account and be ready to start coding at 11.45 am.

### Winter snowflakes

![Many snowflakes](2024_snowflakes_1.png "multi-snowflakes")

At the last session we used the winter weather as a trigger to make a seasonal project to draw a lot of snowflakes on the screen. For this project we had to create two of our own ***functions***, and the code introduced some useful Python features connected with functions. As we didn't quite finish this project we will continue with it at the next session on 25 January, especially to explain how you can "pass a variable" to a function, and explore the difference between *global* and *local* variables. We will also add some random colours for the snowflakes. You can find a useful display of all the available turtle colours [here](https://trinket.io/docs/colors).

You can find the code from the last session [here](https://trinket.io/python/dabf4963ab0d), but for the benefit of those that missed the last session we will pick up the project on 25 January from a slightly earlier stage, using starter code which you can find [here](https://trinket.io/python/ccb7e39eb1b9).

The "rapid explanation" of the starter code is in a powerpoint file which you can download from [here](.github/profile/build_snowflakes.pptx)

If you don't want to join in with the snowflakes project you can continue with projects you were developing from the Raspberry Pi website.


### Challenges for more experience Python coders:

We have devised a series of Python coding challenges to test your abilities. You can find the challenges at
