These are the github pages of the **Wokingham Library Code Club**, located in Wokingham, UK and supported by [Wokingham Borough Council](https://www.wokingham.gov.uk/libraries).

The club is for children aged 9 to 13, and we run twice a month in Wokingham Library, on the first and last Saturday of each month, with an early session mostly for Scratch coding followed by a later session for Python coding.

These pages contain information for students about forthcoming sessions, detailed information for lots of the projects we have developed in the past, as well as background information.

Students wishing to join the Code Club will need to register with Wokingham library. For information about registering and any other enquiries about the Code Club please contact Wokingham library: libraryevents@wokingham.gov.uk

### About this website

As is normal on github, the data on this site is divided into ***repositories*** and each repository (repo for short) contains all the information for a single coding project, or a group of projects. One repository, called [OnlineCodeclub](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/OnlineCodeclub/blob/master/README.md), contains a wide range of Scratch and Python projects, each of which is explained through a series of Youtube videos, and the links to all these videos can be found in the *OnlineCodeClub* repository. (These projects were created while the code club was operating online during the coronavirus restrictions.)

For a summary of the contents of all the repositories see [here](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/woklibcodeclub.github.io), or see the [complete list of repositories](https://github.com/orgs/WokLibCodeClub/repositories?type=all).

## Scratch (first session 10.30am to 11.30am)

The next session will take place on **Saturday 31st January 2026**. We will be coding on the library's own laptops, so you don't need to bring your own computer.

We will start our Scratch coding for 2026 by exploring how to code a game using *video motion sensing*, where we use the laptop camera to detect your body motion and cause the sprites to move accordingly. We will use starter code for this project, and you can find the starter project here: [Video Motion Sensing Starter Project](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1140871196/editor/). You can look at the instructions for this project in a powerpoint file here:

[Video_Motion_Sensing_Scratch_Game_2026.pptx](https://1drv.ms/p/c/0ea54730735a1344/IQC8JJyfUUmjRp3xaB4RTM5iAbX3a58Y1xTgOWWHTxiyvVQ?e=YxB1S5)

<!-- 
Please try to arrive a little bit before 10.30am so that you have time to get logged in to your Code for Life and Scratch accounts and be ready to start at 10.30am. **MAKE SURE YOU KNOW THE PASSWORDS FOR YOUR ACCOUNTS!!!!**
-->

If you want to share your Scratch projects with the Code Club your Scratch account needs to be *confirmed*. Instructions for doing this are [here](https://scratch.mit.edu/faq/#accounts) in the section *How do I confirm my account?*

#### Don't forget *Rapid Router*

If you want to keep improving your coding skills don't forget the [*Rapid Router*](https://www.codeforlife.education/rapidrouter/#) game. ***Please note:*** you need a Code for Life login to access most levels above 21. If you do not have a login please follow the instructions [below](#How-to-make-a-Code-for-Life-account) to make one. 

*Rapid Router* is a lot of fun, but it's much more than a game - it is a very clever way of teaching the main elements of good coding. But, to make the most of it, you have to try and get full marks for every level. If you're don't do this you will be missing out on the learning opportunities of this game.

### How to make a Scratch account

If you don't have an account already you can create one by going to [Join Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/join). You will need to use a parent's valid email address to sign up.

If you want to be able to *SHARE* your Scratch projects with the Code Club and other people you must make sure your account is *confirmed*. You do this by clicking the link on the confirmation email you recieve from Scratch when you create your account. If you don't receive this email follow  the instructions at [this link](https://scratch.mit.edu/faq/#accounts) in the section *How do I confirm my account?*. It seems to be quite common that people can't find the first email sent by Scratch. The instructions show how to have Scratch resend the email.

Scratch has produced a page of information for parents. You can find it [here](https://scratch.mit.edu/parents/).

**Link for the Code Club's Scratch _Studio_**

We use a *Studio* on the Scratch website for sharing projects in the Code Club sessions. The link to this is [WLCC 2025-2026](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/50686841)

### How to make a Code for Life account

To make a *Code for Life* account you will need to use a parent's email address. Go to [www.codeforlife.education/register_form](https://www.codeforlife.education/register_form): enter your date of birth in the **Independent learner** section then fill in the rest of the details, including your parent's email address. Once you have made an account you can login by going to [www.codeforlife.education/play/](https://www.codeforlife.education/play/) and clicking on the *Log in* button.

## Python (second session 11.45am to 12.45pm)

The next session will take place on **Saturday 31st January 2026**. We will be coding on the library's own laptops, so you don't need to bring your own computer.

As we have some Python "newbies" starting at the next session we will have to divide the group into two: 

- for those who haven't used Python before we will go through our introductory "Hello Python" coding sessions
- for the rest of the group, who are already familiar with Python, we will ask you to work through projects on your own, using online instructions, with volunteers on hand to offer assistance if you have any problems. 

#### For those new to Python ####

We have devised an "Introduction to Python" course called *Hello Python*. You can follow along with the coding in the Code Club sessions, or you can look at the material on this website here: [Hello Python](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/Hello-Python/blob/main/README.md)

#### For those with experience of coding in Python ####

We suggest that you choose one or other of the two projects below - Turtle Race or Secure Messages, both on the Raspberry Pi website. The links below take you to the project pages where you will find step by step instructions. Neither of these projects has starter code:

- [Turtle Race](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/turtle-race) where you code several Python turtles to race against one another

Here is a demo of the basic Turtle Race (click Play to start it if the animation doesn't start automatically):

![Turtle Race demo](turtle_race_demo.gif "animation of turtle race")

- [Secure Messages](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/secure-messages) which uses Python to encrypt and decrypt secret messages..

```
Special Instructions for Turtle Race and Secure Messages:
========================================================

DON'T follow the link to the starter project on the Raspberry Pi website
as this will take you to a different Python editor where you won't be able
to save your code.

Instead, create a New Project in your trinket account and give it a name.

As the first line of your code in the new project insert this:

#!/bin/python3

After that you can follow the instructions on the Raspberry Pi site.
```

#### More complicated projects for those who have done some of the beginner Python projects already:

1. [Rock, Paper Scissors with turtles](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/Rock-Paper-Scissors-with-Turtles/blob/master/README.md). This is an animated version of Rock, Paper Scissors with You versus The Computer and uses turtle images to show the different hand shapes. The project uses a lot of Python lists, and some very clever logic for working out who has won.

2. [Hangman](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/Hangman/blob/master/README.md) This is a very old game which people used to play using paper and pencil. In the computer version you have to guess a mystery word by suggesting letters and finding out if they are in the word or not. If you don't get the word in six guesses you will be hanged!!! This project also shows how you can import data from a text file into a Python project. We have updated the instructions to show how to import your own word list into the game.

3. [Python clock](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/Python-Clock/blob/master/README.md). We made this project when the classroom clock broke, and we needed to be able to tell the time to know when to go home. You will make a digital clock with Python first, then extend it to make a round clock with hands, using Python turtles.

4. [Space Race](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/SpaceRace/blob/master/README.md). Move your rocket from the bottom to the top of the screen - but if you get hit by an asteroid on the way you will be instantly transported back to the start! This is a re-creation of an arcade game which was first invented in the 1970s. The instructions will show you how to build the game, but they don't give a complete explanation of how the code is actually working. You will have to look at your code as you write it and figure this out for yourself.


### How to make a Trinket account

You will need a trinket account for the Code Club's Python sessions. If you don't have one already you can create one by going to [trinket.io/signup](https://trinket.io/signup). You will need a valid email address to create an account. You can find a guide for using a trinket account [here](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/Hello-Python/blob/main/trinket_basics/using_trinket.md).

Please try to arrive a little bit before 11.45am so that you have time to get logged in to your Trinket account and be ready to start at 11.45am. **MAKE SURE YOU KNOW THE PASSWORD FOR YOUR ACCOUNT!!!!**
