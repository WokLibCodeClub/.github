**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

These are the github pages of the Wokingham Library Code Club, located in Wokingham, UK.

The club is for children aged 9 to 12, and we run twice a month in Wokingham library, on the first and fourth Saturday, with one session for Scratch projects and another for Python projects.

These pages contain repositories for lots of the projects we have developed as well as some background information. One section, called [OnlineCodeclub](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/OnlineCodeclub), lists the projects we created while the code club was operating online, during the coronavirus restrictions. For each of the online sessions we created a summary video afterwards, and the links to all these videos can be found in this repository.

For a summary of the contents of all the repositories see [here](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/woklibcodeclub.github.io), or see the list of all repositories below (click on the panel that says "View all repositories" to see the complete list).

### Next sessions

Our next sessions will be on Saturday 27th April 2024 at Wokingham Library.

#### Scratch

We will be working on a project called *Don't Fall In* during the session.

If anyone is interested in entering a national Scratch competition there is one called **Young Coders Competition** which is running at the moment. Unfortunately the deadline is only a couple of weeks away - entries need to be in by 10 May 2024. You can find details of the competition at [https://codingcompetition.org/](https://codingcompetition.org/).

If anyone wants to enter you will have to do it through the library Code Club, and the volunteers will submit all the entries, so let us know on Saturday, or any other time by contacting Sarah Jenkins at Wokingham Library.

#### Python

In the Python session we will be starting sessions for Python beginner coders. At the same time we will have some *Python Challenges* for the more experienced coders to tackle. Experienced coders can also work on projects from the Raspberry Pi website or their own projects if they wish, and the volunteers will be on hand to help.

The link to the *Python Challenges* will appear here just before the next session!

Please try to be there, logged in to your trinket account, in time to start coding at 11.45am.

#### Previous Python projects

In the last couple of months we have completed a couple of Python games. Here are the links to the code for the finished games:

##### TurtleIt!

a turtle (or frog) squashing game, which we finished on 23 February 2024. Finished code at

[trinket.io/python/5586c04f33](https://trinket.io/python/5586c04f33)

##### Simple Space Race

a game to move a rocket from bottom to top of the screen and avoid being hit by asteroids, finished on 23 March 2024. Finished code at

[trinket.io/python/949b023cda](https://trinket.io/python/949b023cda)

If you want to build the full **Space Race** game, with rocks coming from both directions you can find the instructions here:

[Space Race for Python](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/OnlineCodeclub/blob/master/space_race.md)

If you are going to do this it would be best to start a completely new Python project. Don't try to adapt the simple version, as there are a lot of things which are different.
