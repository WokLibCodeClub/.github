These are the github pages of the Wokingham Library Code Club, located in Wokingham, UK.

The club is for children aged 9 to 12, and we run twice a month in Wokingham library, on the first and fourth Saturday, with one session for Scratch projects and another for Python projects.

These pages contain repositories for lots of the projects we have developed as well as some background information. One repository, called [OnlineCodeclub](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/OnlineCodeclub), lists the projects we created while the code club was operating online, during the coronavirus restrictions. For each of the online sessions we created a summary video afterwards, and the links to all these videos can be found in this repository.

For a summary of the contents of all the repositories see [here](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/woklibcodeclub.github.io), or see the list of all repositories below (click on the panel at the very bottom of the page that says "View all repositories" to see the complete list).

### Next sessions

Our next sessions will be on Saturday 22nd June 2024 at Wokingham Library.

***IT'S micro:bit TIME!!!!!!***

For both sessions, for the last two dates of the term, we will be coding using the popular ***BBC micro:bit*** mini-computers. 

#### Scratch

Please try to be there in time to start coding at 10.30am.

We will be learning coding  with the BBC micro:bit using the website [makecode.microbit.org/](https://makecode.microbit.org/) which offers a block coding language very similar to Scratch. 

If anyone would prefer to continue working on Scratch projects and not on the BBC micro:bits, then that's fine, but, be warned, the volunteers will be spending most of their time on micro:bits.

#### Python

Please try to be there in time to start coding at 11.45am.

We will be coding the BBC micro:bits using Python, at the website [python.microbit.org/v/3](https://python.microbit.org/v/3) which uses the ```microbit``` Python library, and allows for much more complex programming than with block coding.

### End of Introduction to Python course:

We finished our quick introduction to Python coding on 1 June 2024, by coding a simple game called *Catch the ball*.

Here are some useful links for the four sessions of this short course.

**Week 1**

We wrote some first Python code, introducing the basic functions ```print()``` and ```input()```. We also introduced Python *libraries*, which have to be imported. The code from the first week can be found at [trinket.io/python/05d317e0a9](https://trinket.io/python/05d317e0a9)

We also discussed the rules for how to *name variables*:

- Variable names can only include the lower case letters a-z, the upper case letters A-Z, the numbers 0-9 and the underscore _ character.

- Variable names must begin with a letter or the underscore character, never a number; and they can't have any spaces in them.

- It's a good idea to avoid calling variables with the same name as a Python function, like <code>print</code> or <code>input</code> or <code>name</code>.

- In addition there are some prohibited words (called keywords) that you absolutely ***can't*** use for variable names. These are:

> <code>and, as, assert, break, class, continue, def, del, elif, else, except, exec, finally, for, from, global, if, import, in, is, lambda, not, or, pass, print, raise, return, try, while, with, yield</code>

**Week 2**

We extended the ideas of variables, and doing maths and wrote a programme to calculated someone's age given the year they were born. We had to learn the Python ```if``` block to make this work for everyone. The code for the *Age Calculator* is at [trinket.io/python/1c40b6db37](https://trinket.io/python/1c40b6db37).

**Week 3**

We started doing Python graphics using the *turtle* library and wrote code to get the turtle to draw a regular polygon with any number of sides. The code we wrote in Week 3 is at [trinket.io/python/7407d0a2eb](https://trinket.io/python/7407d0a2eb)

The web page which shows all the named colours available in Python is at [w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp). You can choose any of these colours in a graphics programme by simply putting the colour name, as it appears on this page, inside quotes: for example ```"AntiqueWhite"```.

The trinket project which showed the x and y coordinates for the point where the mouse was clicked is at [trinket.io/python/218c2a1835](https://trinket.io/python/218c2a1835).

**Week 4**

We coded a simple game called *Catch the ball* which involved writing code for clicking on a turtle, using an image file as the turtle shape, and writing our own functions.

You can find the starter project for the *Catch the ball* game at [trinket.io/python/0e429f731b](https://trinket.io/python/0e429f731b).

The code as it was at the end of the session is at [trinket.io/python/da871a6618](https://trinket.io/python/da871a6618).

### Challenges for more experience Python coders:

We have devised a series of Python coding challenges to test your abilities. You can find the challenges at
