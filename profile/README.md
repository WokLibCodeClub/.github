🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?

These are the github pages of the Wokingham Library Code Club, located in Wokingham, UK.

The club is for children aged 9 to 12, and we run twice a month in Wokingham library, on the first and fourth Saturday, with one session for Scratch projects and another for Python projects.

These pages contain repositories for lots of the projects we have developed as well as some background information. One section, called [OnlineCodeclub](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/OnlineCodeclub), lists the projects we created while the code club was operating online, during the coronavirus restrictions. For each of the online sessions we created a summary video afterwards, and the links to all these videos can be found in this repository.

For a summary of the contents of all the repositories see [here](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/woklibcodeclub.github.io), or see the list of all repositories below (click on the panel that says "View all repositories" to see the complete list).

### Next sessions

Our next sessions will be on Saturday 2nd March 2024 at Wokingham Library.

#### Python

In the Python session we will start coding a simple version of a game called Space Race.

Here is an example of what the game might look like:

although our game will be a bit simpler, with rocks only coming from one side.

There is a starter project in trinket and the link is:

[trinket.io/python3b8a6c8a96](https://trinket.io/python/3b8a6c8a96)

We have a lot to get through in the session, so please try to be there, logged in, in time to start coding at 10.45am.
