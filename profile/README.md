# Wokingham Library Code Club

These are the github pages of the **Wokingham Library Code Club**, located in Wokingham, UK and supported by [Wokingham Borough Council](https://www.wokingham.gov.uk/libraries).

The club is for children aged 9 to 13, and we run twice a month in Wokingham Library, on the first and fourth Saturday of each month, with an early session mostly for Scratch coding followed by a later session for Python coding.

These pages contain information for students about forthcoming sessions, detailed information for lots of the projects we have developed in the past, as well as background information.

Students wishing to join the Code Club will need to register with Wokingham library. For information about registering and any other enquiries about the Code Club please contact Wokingham library: libraryevents@wokingham.gov.uk

### About this website

As is normal on github, the data on this site is divided into ***repositories*** and each repository (repo for short) contains all the information for a single coding project, or a group of projects. One repository, called [OnlineCodeclub](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/OnlineCodeclub/blob/master/README.md), contains a wide range of Scratch and Python projects, each of which is explained through a series of Youtube videos, and the links to all these videos can be found in the *OnlineCodeClub* repository. (These projects were created while the code club was operating online during the coronavirus restrictions.)

For a summary of the contents of all the repositories see [here](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/woklibcodeclub.github.io), or see the [complete list of repositories](https://github.com/orgs/WokLibCodeClub/repositories?type=all).

## Next Code Club sessions

Our next sessions will take place on **Saturday 6th September 2025** in the *small meeting room* at Wokingham Library, Carnival Hub, Wellington Road, RG40 2AF.

---

## Scratch (first session 10.30am to 11.30am)

The next session will take place on **Saturday 6th September 2025**. As this is the first session of the new school year we will be covering the basics of coding. This will involve the coding game called *Code for Life Rapid Router*, and some beginner projects in Scratch. We will be coding on the library's own laptops, so you don't need to bring your own computer.

Please try to arrive a little bit before 10.30am so that you have time to get logged in to your Code for Life and Scratch accounts and be ready to start at 10.30am. **MAKE SURE YOU KNOW THE PASSWORDS FOR YOUR ACCOUNTS!!!!**

You will need a accounts for both *Scratch* and *Code for Life: Rapid Router* for the Code Club's Scratch sessions. 

### Scratch account

If you don't have an acocunt already you can create one by going to [Join Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/join). You will need to use a parent's valid email address to sign up.

If you want to be able to *SHARE* your Scratch projects with the Code Club and other people you must make sure your account is *confirmed*. You do this by clicking the link on the confirmation email you recieve from Scratch when you create your account. If you don't receive this email follow  the instructions at [this link](https://scratch.mit.edu/faq/#accounts) under the heading *How do I confirm my account?*. It seems to be quite common that people can't find the first email sent by Scratch. The instructions show how to have Scratch resend the email.

Scratch has produced a page of information for parents. You can find it [here](https://scratch.mit.edu/parents/).

**Link for the Code Club's Scratch _Studio_**

We use a *Studio* on the Scratch website for sharing projects in the Code Club sessions. The link to this is [WLCC 2025-2026](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/50686841)

### Rapid Router account

To make a *Code for Life* account you will need to use a parent's email address. Go to [www.codeforlife.education/register_form](https://www.codeforlife.education/register_form): enter your date of birth in the **Independent learner** section then fill in the rest of the details, including your parent's email address. Once you have made an account you can login by going to [www.codeforlife.education/play/](https://www.codeforlife.education/play/) and clicking on the *Log in* button.

## Python (second session 11.45am to 12.45pm)

The next session will take place on **Saturday 6th September 2025**. 

### Trinket account

You will need a trinket account for the Code Club's Python sessions. If you don't have one already you can create one by going to [trinket.io/signup](https://trinket.io/signup). You will need a valid email address to create an account. You can find a guide for using a trinket account [here](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/Hello-Python/blob/main/trinket_basics/using_trinket.md).

### Suggestions for Python projects

For Python coders here are some suggestions of weblinks where you can find projects to try out over the summer:

#### More complicated projects for coders with lots of Python experience

These are projects described in YouTube videos where you can code along. We made these videos while the Code Club was operating online during the coronavirus pandemic.

1. [Python Simulator](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/OnlineCodeclub/blob/master/simulator.md) This project uses Python turtles to make a simulator - but you'll have to try the project to find out what we are simulating.

2. [Python Solar System Model](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/OnlineCodeclub/blob/master/planets.md) We code up an animated diagram of the planets of the inner Solar System, and try to ensure that the planets are all the correct size relative to each other, and they go round the sun at the correct speed, relative to each other.

3. [The Ancient Game of Nim for Python](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/OnlineCodeclub/blob/master/nim.md) We use multiple turtles to represent matches in a very old game where two players take matches from a pile according to certain rules, and win by forcing the other player to take the last match.

4. [Python Fractal Tree](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/OnlineCodeclub/blob/master/tree.md) This project teaches a special type of function, called a *recursive function*, which allows us to draw really complex patterns using only a few lines of code.

These projects are part of a series of projects, and you can find the full list at [OnlineCodeClub](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/OnlineCodeclub/blob/master/README.md)

#### Challenges for more experienced Python coders:

We have devised a series of Python coding challenges to test your abilities. You can find the challenges at

&nbsp;&nbsp;[https://woklibcodeclub.github.io/site/coding_challenges/index.html](https://woklibcodeclub.github.io/site/coding_challenges/index.html)

#### Projects for those who have done some of the beginner Python projects already:

1. [Rock, Paper Scissors with turtles](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/Rock-Paper-Scissors-with-Turtles/blob/master/README.md). This is an animated version of Rock, Paper Scissors with You versus The Computer and uses turtle images to show the different hand shapes. The project uses a lot of Python lists, and some very clever logic for working out who has won.

2. [Hangman](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/Hangman/blob/master/README.md) This is a very old game which people used to play using paper and pencil. In the computer version you have to guess a mystery word by suggesting letters and finding out if they are in the word or not. If you don't get the word in six guesses you will be hanged!!! This project also shows how you can import data from a text file into a Python project. We have updated the instructions to show how to import your own word list into the game.

3. [Python clock](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/Python-Clock/blob/master/README.md). We made this project when the classroom clock broke, and we needed to be able to tell the time to know when to go home. You will make a digital clock with Python first, then extend it to make a round clock with hands, using Python turtles.

4. [Space Race](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/SpaceRace/blob/master/README.md). Move your rocket from the bottom to the top of the screen - but if you get hit by an asteroid on the way you will be instantly transported back to the start! This is a re-creation of an arcade game which was first invented in the 1970s. The instructions will show you how to build the game, but they don't give a complete explanation of how the code is actually working. You will have to look at your code as you write it and figure this out for yourself.

#### Help for those who are starting out with Python for the first time:

We suggest following our beginners Python course called *Hello Python* which you can find [here](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/Hello-Python/blob/main/README.md).
