# Wokingham Library Code Club

These are the github pages of the **Wokingham Library Code Club**, located in Wokingham, UK and supported by [Wokingham Borough Council](https://www.wokingham.gov.uk/libraries).

The club is for children aged 9 to 12, and we run twice a month in Wokingham Library, on the first and fourth Saturday of each month, with a session for Scratch coding followed by a session for Python coding.

These pages contain information for students about forthcoming sessions, detailed information for lots of the projects we have developed in the past, as well as background information.

As is normal on github, the data on this site is divided into ***repositories*** and each repository (repo for short) contains all the information for a single coding project, or a group of projects. One repository, called [OnlineCodeclub](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/OnlineCodeclub), contains a wide range of Scratch and Python projects, each of which is explained through a series of Youtube videos, and the links to all these videos can be found in the *OnlineCodeClub* repository. (These projects were created while the code club was operating online during the coronavirus restrictions.)

For a summary of the contents of all the repositories see [here](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/woklibcodeclub.github.io), or see the [complete list of repositories](https://github.com/orgs/WokLibCodeClub/repositories?type=all).

#### Lower Earley Code Club

Wokingham Libraries now also runs a Code Club at Lower Earley Library. Ask for details at Lower Earley Library.

## Next sessions

Our next sessions will take place on Saturday 7th December 2024 at Wokingham Library.

## Scratch session, Saturday 7th December 2024 at 10.30 am

You will need a Scratch account for this session, so if you don't have one already you should create one by going to [Join Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/join). You will need a valid email address to sign up.

Please make sure you arrive so that you have time to log in to your Scratch account and be ready to start coding at 10.30 am. ***PLEASE*** make sure you know your password (write it down if you need to) so that you are able to log in without a problem on Saturday.

**NOTE**: If you want to be able to *share* your Scratch projects with the club leaders and other coders your Scratch account needs to be *confirmed*. You can find the instructions for doing this at [this](https://scratch.mit.edu/faq/#accounts) weblink, under the heading *How do I confirm my account?*. It seems to be quite common that people can't find the first email sent by Scratch. In this case, follow the instructions to have Scratch resend the email.

Scratch has produced a page of information for parents. You can find it [here](https://scratch.mit.edu/parents/).

### Scratch Coordinate Bingo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

We are going to use our last session before Christmas to play a game - it's called ***Scratch Coordinate Bingo***, and it will teach you all about Scratch coordinates while you (hopefully) have fun, and get a chance to win the game!

#### Rapid Router

At the last session on 23 November lots of the students got very enthusiastic about the [Rapid Router game](https://www.codeforlife.education/rapidrouter) on the *Code For Life* website. We won't be doing this game at the session on 7 December, but feel free to progress with the levels at home. If you would like to save your progress and your code as you work through the levels, you should make yourself a *Code for Life* account by following the instructions:

#### Signing up for a Code for Life account

If you want to save your progress in *Code for Life* as you progress through the levels you can make a *Code for Life* account, and to do this you will need to use a parent's email address. We will show you how you can do this at the session, but you will need to do this at home during the week. The webpage for signing up is [https://www.codeforlife.education/register_form](https://www.codeforlife.education/register_form): enter your date of birth in the **Independent learner** section then fill in the rest of the details, including your parent's email address. Once you have made an account you can login by going to [codeforlife.education/play/](https://www.codeforlife.education/play/) and clicking on the Log in button.

We will also continue with Scratch projects which students have been working on. Some are still working on [Catch the bus](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/catch-the-bus) but for those that have finished that one we will move on to a project called [Find the Bug](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/find-the-bug).

## Python session, 7th December at 11.45 am

You will need an account with [trinket](https://trinket.io/) for this session, so if you don't have one already you should create one by going to [trinket.io/signup](https://trinket.io/signup). You will need a valid email address to sign up.

Please make sure you arrive so that you have time to log in to your trinket account and be ready to start coding at 11.45 am.

### Christmas cheer!

We will use our last session before Christmas to code a seasonal project to draw snowflakes all over the screen. Let's hope there's not too much real snow outside on the day...


#### Super turtle race

At the last session on 23 November 2024 we coded a super-charged turtle race with an unlimited number of turtles (well, depending on how many would fit on the screen). If you want to look at the code for this project you can find it [here](https://trinket.io/python/6ad31db09fd1). (Actually, the code at this link has had a couple of tweaks added since the end of the session - the starting positions of the grid and the racing turtles has been shifted upwards, so more turtles will fit on the screen - see the comments in the code to see how this was done, and the code for the grid lines has been adjusted so it draws the right length lines for the number of turtles.)



### Challenges for more experience Python coders:

We have devised a series of Python coding challenges to test your abilities. You can find the challenges at
