**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

These are the github pages of the Wokingham Library Code Club, located in Wokingham, UK.

The club is for children aged 9 to 12, and we run twice a month in Wokingham library, on the first and fourth Saturday, with one session for Scratch projects and another for Python projects.

These pages contain repositories for lots of the projects we have developed as well as some background information. One section, called [OnlineCodeclub](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/OnlineCodeclub), lists the projects we created while the code club was operating online, during the coronavirus restrictions. For each of the online sessions we created a summary video afterwards, and the links to all these videos can be found in this repository.

For a summary of the contents of all the repositories see [here](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/woklibcodeclub.github.io), or see the list of all repositories below (click on the panel that says "View all repositories" to see the complete list).

### Next sessions

Our next sessions will be on Saturday 4th May 2024 at Wokingham Library.

#### Scratch

We will continue working on the platform project called *Don't Fall In*. The project instructions are at [https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/dont-fall-in](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/dont-fall-in)

If you are interested in entering the **Young Coders Competition** let the volunteers know at the session and we will set up an entry for you. You don't need to have your project finished for our session on 4th May, but you will need to finish it before the deadline of 10th May. We will submit your entry when you tell us it is finished. You can find details of the competition at [https://codingcompetition.org/](https://codingcompetition.org/).

#### Python

##### For our new Python coders:

We will continue learning the basics of Python, by writing code for an Age Calculator. If you would like to check up on the code we wrote during the last session you can find the code (with a lot of Python comments added to explain what we were doing) at this link:

&nbsp;&nbsp;[trinket.io/python/05d317e0a9](https://trinket.io/python/05d317e0a9)

*Naming variables*

- Variable names can only include the lower case letters a-z, the upper case letters A-Z, the numbers 0-9 and the underscore _ character.

- Variable names must begin with a letter or the underscore character, never a number; and they can't have any spaces in them.

- It's a good idea to avoid calling variables with the same name as a Python function, like <code>print</code> or <code>input</code> or <code>name</code>.

- In addition there are some prohibited words (called keywords) that you absolutely ***can't*** use for variable names. These are:

<code>and, as, assert, break, class, continue, def, del, elif, else, except, exec, finally, for, from, global, if, import, in, is, lambda, not, or, pass, print, raise, return, try, while, with, yield</code>

If we have time to start looking at Python turtle graphics, then there is a trinket project you might want to look at. The link is

You may also be interested in a list of all the named colours available in Python, which can be found at

##### For more experience Python coders:

We suggest you continue solving our *Python Challenges* which you can find at this link:

&nbsp;&nbsp;[https://woklibcodeclub.github.io/site/coding_challenges/index.html](https://woklibcodeclub.github.io/site/coding_challenges/index.html)

Please try to be there, logged in to your trinket account, in time to start coding at 11.45am.

#### Previous Python projects

In the last couple of months we have completed a couple of Python games. Here are the links to the code for the finished games:

##### TurtleIt!

a turtle (or frog) squashing game, which we finished on 23 February 2024. Finished code at

&nbsp;&nbsp;[trinket.io/python/5586c04f33](https://trinket.io/python/5586c04f33)

##### Simple Space Race

a game to move a rocket from bottom to top of the screen and avoid being hit by asteroids, finished on 23 March 2024. Finished code at

&nbsp;&nbsp;[trinket.io/python/949b023cda](https://trinket.io/python/949b023cda)

If you want to build the full **Space Race** game, with rocks coming from both directions you can find the instructions here:

&nbsp;&nbsp;[Space Race for Python](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/OnlineCodeclub/blob/master/space_race.md)

If you are going to do this it would be best to start a completely new Python project. Don't try to adapt the simple version, as there are a lot of things which are different.
