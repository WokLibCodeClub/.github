# Wokingham Library Code Club

These are the github pages of the **Wokingham Library Code Club**, located in Wokingham, UK and supported by [Wokingham Borough Council](https://www.wokingham.gov.uk/libraries).

The club is for children aged 9 to 12, and we run twice a month in Wokingham Library, on the first and fourth Saturday of each month, with a session for Scratch coding followed by a session for Python coding.

These pages contain information for students about forthcoming sessions, detailed information for lots of the projects we have developed in the past, as well as background information.

As is normal on github, the data on this site is divided into ***repositories*** and each repository (repo for short) contains all the information for a single coding project, or a group of projects. One repository, called [OnlineCodeclub](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/OnlineCodeclub/blob/master/README.md), contains a wide range of Scratch and Python projects, each of which is explained through a series of Youtube videos, and the links to all these videos can be found in the *OnlineCodeClub* repository. (These projects were created while the code club was operating online during the coronavirus restrictions.)

For a summary of the contents of all the repositories see [here](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/woklibcodeclub.github.io), or see the [complete list of repositories](https://github.com/orgs/WokLibCodeClub/repositories?type=all).

## Next sessions

Our next sessions will take place on Saturday 1st February 2025 at Wokingham Library.

## Scratch session, Saturday 1st February 2025 at 10.30 am

You will need a Scratch account for this session, so if you don't have one already you should create one by going to [Join Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/join). You will need a valid email address to sign up.

Please make sure you arrive so that you have time to log in to your Scratch account and be ready to start coding at 10.30 am. ***PLEASE*** make sure you know your password (write it down if you need to) so that you are able to log in without a problem on Saturday.

**NOTE**: If you want to be able to *share* your Scratch projects with the club leaders and other coders your Scratch account needs to be *confirmed*. You can find the instructions for doing this at [this](https://scratch.mit.edu/faq/#accounts) weblink, under the heading *How do I confirm my account?*. It seems to be quite common that people can't find the first email sent by Scratch. In this case, follow the instructions to have Scratch resend the email.

Scratch has produced a page of information for parents. You can find it [here](https://scratch.mit.edu/parents/).

### Scratch

At the next session on 1st February we will make a project to test your concentration!

### Rapid Router

Some students might like to continue with a bit more of the [Rapid Router game](https://www.codeforlife.education/rapidrouter) on the *Code For Life* website as some of our coders have been getting very enthusiastic about this. If you would like to save your progress and your code as you work through the levels, you should make yourself a *Code for Life* account by following the instructions below:

#### Signing up for a Code for Life account

If you want to save your progress in *Code for Life* as you progress through the levels you can make a *Code for Life* account, and to do this you will need to use a parent's email address. We will show you how you can do this at the session, but you will need to do this at home during the week. The webpage for signing up is [https://www.codeforlife.education/register_form](https://www.codeforlife.education/register_form): enter your date of birth in the **Independent learner** section then fill in the rest of the details, including your parent's email address. Once you have made an account you can login by going to [codeforlife.education/play/](https://www.codeforlife.education/play/) and clicking on the Log in button.

## Python session, 1st February 2025 at 11.45 am

You will need an account with [trinket](https://trinket.io/) for this session, so if you don't have one already you should create one by going to [trinket.io/signup](https://trinket.io/signup). You will need a valid email address to sign up.

Please make sure you arrive so that you have time to log in to your trinket account and be ready to start coding at 11.45 am.

We will have a peaceful and relaxed Python session on 1 February, with no code-along project. Students can decide which project they would like to do, and follow the online instructions.

### For those with very little Python experience:

We suggest following our beginners Python course called *Hello Python* which you can find [here](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/Hello-Python/blob/main/README.md).

### For those who have done some of the first Python projects already:

Here are some suggestions for projects. If you follow the links you will find step by step instructions for building up your project:

1. [Rock, Paper Scissors with turtles](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/Rock-Paper-Scissors-with-Turtles/blob/master/README.md). This is an animated version of Rock, Paper Scissors with You versus The Computer and uses turtle images to show the different hand shapes. The project uses a lot of Python lists, and some very clever logic for working out who has won.

2. [Hangman](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/Hangman/blob/master/README.md) This is a very old game which people used to play using paper and pencil. In the computer version you have to guess a mystery word by suggesting letters and finding out if they are in the word or not. If you don't get the word in six guesses you will be hanged!!! This project also shows how you can import data from a text file into a Python project.

3. [Python clock](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/Python-Clock/blob/master/README.md). We made this project when the classroom clock broke, and we needed to be able to tell the time to know when to go home. You will make a digital clock with Python first, then extend it to make a round clock with hands, using Python turtles.

### Challenges for more experience Python coders:

We have devised a series of Python coding challenges to test your abilities. You can find the challenges at
