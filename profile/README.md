🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?

These are the github pages of the Wokingham Library Code Club, located in Wokingham, UK.

The club is for children aged 9 to 12, and we run twice a month in Wokingham library, on the first and fourth Saturday, with one session for Scratch projects and another for Python projects.

These pages contain repositories for lots of the projects we have developed as well as some background information. One section, called [OnlineCodeclub](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/OnlineCodeclub), lists the projects we created while the code club was operating online, during the coronavirus restrictions. For each of the online sessions we created a summary video afterwards, and the links to all these videos can be found in this repository.

For a summary of the contents of all the repositories see [here](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/woklibcodeclub.github.io), or see the list of all repositories below (click on the panel that says "View all repositories" to see the complete list).

### Next sessions

Our next sessions will be on Saturday 1st June 2024 at Wokingham Library.

#### Scratch

Please try to be there, logged in to your Scratch account, in time to start coding at 10.30am.

There will be lots of choice for projects this week - those that started a project to animate their name may want to continue with that; for anyone still working on the platform project called *Don't Fall In*, they will be able to complete it; and for anyone else we can choose from a variety of projects on the Raspberry Pi website, or from anywhere else!

*Advanced warning*: for the last two sessions of the term (22 June, and 6 July) we have borrowed a set of BBC micro:bits to experiment with, so we will be writing code for those.

#### Python

Please try to be there, logged in to your trinket account, in time to start coding at 11.45am.

##### For our new Python coders:

We will finish our quick introduction to Python coding by completing the *Catch the ball* game (which we just had a first look at at the end of the last session) where we show that Python turtles can take their shape from image files as well as pre-defined patterns, and that we can code for things to happen when you click on them.

The starter project for the *Catch the ball* game is at [trinket.io/python/0e429f731b](https://trinket.io/python/0e429f731b)

*Previous weeks in the introduction to Python series*

Here are links to code which we wrote during the first three weeks of this course:

**Week 1**

We wrote some first Python code, introducing the basic functions ```print()``` and ```input()```. We also introduced Python *libraries*, which have to be imported. The code from the first week can be found at [trinket.io/python/05d317e0a9](https://trinket.io/python/05d317e0a9)

We also discussed the rules for how to *name variables*:

- Variable names can only include the lower case letters a-z, the upper case letters A-Z, the numbers 0-9 and the underscore _ character.

- Variable names must begin with a letter or the underscore character, never a number; and they can't have any spaces in them.

- It's a good idea to avoid calling variables with the same name as a Python function, like <code>print</code> or <code>input</code> or <code>name</code>.

- In addition there are some prohibited words (called keywords) that you absolutely ***can't*** use for variable names. These are:

> <code>and, as, assert, break, class, continue, def, del, elif, else, except, exec, finally, for, from, global, if, import, in, is, lambda, not, or, pass, print, raise, return, try, while, with, yield</code>

**Week 2**

We extended the ideas of variables, and doing maths and wrote a programme to calculated someone's age given the year they were born. We had to learn the Python ```if``` block to make this work. The code for the *Age Calculator* is at [trinket.io/python/1c40b6db37](https://trinket.io/python/1c40b6db37).

**Week 3**

We started doing Python graphics using the *turtle* library and wrote code to get the turtle to draw a regular polygon with any number of sides. The code we wrote in Week 3 is at [trinket.io/python/7407d0a2eb](https://trinket.io/python/7407d0a2eb)

The web page which shows all the named colours available in Python is at [w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp). You can choose any of these colours in a graphics programme by simply putting the colour name, as it appears on this page, inside quotes: for example ```"AntiqueWhite"```.

The trinket project which showed the x and y coordinates for the point where the mouse was clicked is at [trinket.io/python/218c2a1835](https://trinket.io/python/218c2a1835).

##### For more experience Python coders:

We suggest you have a last go at solving our *Python Challenges* which you can find at this link:

&nbsp;&nbsp;[https://woklibcodeclub.github.io/site/coding_challenges/index.html](https://woklibcodeclub.github.io/site/coding_challenges/index.html)

##### *Advanced warning*:

For the last two sessions of the term (22 June, and 6 July) we have borrowed a set of BBC micro:bits to experiment with, so we will be writing Python code for those. If you have seen BBC micro:bits before but with Scratch-type coding you will find out that there's a whole lot more you can do with them if you write Python code instead!


#### Previous Python projects

In the last couple of months we have completed a couple of Python games. Here are the links to the code for the finished games:

##### TurtleIt!

a turtle (or frog) squashing game, which we finished on 23 February 2024. Finished code at

&nbsp;&nbsp;[trinket.io/python/5586c04f33](https://trinket.io/python/5586c04f33)

##### Simple Space Race

a game to move a rocket from bottom to top of the screen and avoid being hit by asteroids, finished on 23 March 2024. Finished code at

&nbsp;&nbsp;[trinket.io/python/949b023cda](https://trinket.io/python/949b023cda)

If you want to build the full **Space Race** game, with rocks coming from both directions you can find the instructions here:

&nbsp;&nbsp;[Space Race for Python](https://github.com/WokLibCodeClub/OnlineCodeclub/blob/master/space_race.md)

If you are going to do this it would be best to start a completely new Python project. Don't try to adapt the simple version, as there are a lot of things which are different.
